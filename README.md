# DLLInjector
Basic DLL injector that uses LoadLibraryA/W. Hopefully, I will add soon a ManualMapping loading method.

The easiest way to use this injector is to run it from the CMD and add as arguments the process' name and the DLL's path. You can also write these arguments as input after running the program.
